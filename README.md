# DeepLearningModelExploration

This project focuses on using deep learning models to perform machine learning tasks including binary classification, multi-label classification, and regression

The purpose is to create workflows that train deep learning models and then produce validation and metrics on those models.

There were a total of 3 models that used code to create a workflow that a) trains the model, b) uses the model to perform model validation, and c) outputting model metrics. 

The models used datasets implemented within keras to create a movie review classifier, a news classifier and a housing price regression model.
